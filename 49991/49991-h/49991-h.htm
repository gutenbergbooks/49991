<p>The author and artist are indebted to a great many scientists and other careful observers who
have lived among the Eskimos. The whole record of our sources is too long to give, but here are
some we have found particularly helpful: various writings of Dr. Franz Boas, Vilhjalmur Stefansson,
Rockwell Kent; also the Federal Writers Project, <cite>A Guide to Alaska</cite>, and books by Edward
Moffat Weyer, Jr., Clarence L. Andrews, Aage Gilberg, Knut Rasmussen, Fridtjof Nansen and
Peter Freuchen. Many articles in the <cite>National Geographic Magazine</cite> have been consulted, as have
publications of the United States Natural History Museum. In addition to valuable pictorial material
in most of the foregoing, we have received assistance in preparing illustrations from the
Fish and Wild Life Service of the United States Department of the Interior.</p>

<p>Without help from all these sources and others, too, this book would not have been possible.
Very special thanks go to Dr. Ruth Bunzel, anthropologist with the Bureau of Applied Social
Research of Columbia University, for her advice regarding the manuscript.</p></div>

<h2>THE LAUGHING PEOPLE</h2>


<p>If you could look down at the
world from high above the North
Pole, this is what you would see&mdash;an
icy ocean with land almost all
around it. The brown-skinned people
who have lived along this shore
for many hundreds of years are
Eskimos.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 386px;">

<div class="caption"><p>a harpoon</p></div>
</div>

<p>When white men first met the Eskimos, they were surprised
by several things. The Eskimos never used salt. They
lived on nothing but meat and fish and water. And they were
the most cheerful people in the world. An Eskimo laughed
more in a day than anyone else did in a week.</p>

<p>Nobody knows exactly where these laughing people came
from but many scientists think they traveled across from
Siberia into Alaska, just as their cousins the Indians did.
Nobody knows why they decided to stay there near the top
of the world. But we do know that Eskimos like the country
where they live. They settled along the shore of the ocean
where they could find both sea and land animals to eat. The
weather there was not as cold as it was farther inland or
even in some parts of the United States.</p>

<p>Long ago Eskimos invented wonderful ways of getting
food and of staying warm. They trained dogs to pull their
sleds. They learned to find their way home over great fields
of drifted snow, even in the dark night. They knew exactly
what to do in order to live and have a good time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption"><p>Papik with his fish spear</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Eskimo people found different ways of living in different
parts of the Arctic country. But everywhere they had
many of the same customs. Some groups settled near forests,
and they used wood in their tools and for building igloos.
(<em>Igloo</em> is the Eskimo word for house, no matter what it is
made of.) Other groups had no trees, so they made skin tents
for summer and snow houses for winter, and they used bone
and ivory for tools. One group lived where they could find
chunks of pure copper which they made into tools. A very
few learned to make tools from the iron in meteorites. (A
meteorite is a shooting star that has landed on the earth.)</p>


<h3>THE PEOPLE</h3>

<div class="caption"><p>a

</div>

<p>When white men moved into the Arctic country, Eskimos
borrowed many modern inventions, such as guns and stoves,
and they changed many of their old ways of living. But they
still think they are luckier than people who live where houses
are big and hard to build and the hot summers are long.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 140px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe08c.jpg" width="140" height="242" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>an

</div>

<p>Summer in Eskimo land is often hot, but it's always short.
For several weeks the sun shines night and day. Winter lasts
for more than half of every year up there, and for several
weeks the sun doesn't shine at all&mdash;it's dark night twenty-four
hours a day.</p>

<p>A great many customs in the warmer parts of the world
seem strange and silly to the Eskimos. They think they do
things the way people should naturally do them. In fact, they
call themselves The People.</p>

<p>The fringe of land where The People spend their lives
belongs to different countries now. Part of it belongs to the
United States, part to Canada and Denmark and the Soviet
Union. But The People are still Eskimos. They all talk the
Eskimo language wherever they live.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 401px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe09.jpg" width="401" height="500" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Their language is one of the hardest in the world to learn.
In order to speak it, you must know many more words than
most people ever learn in order to speak English. In the old
days Eskimos had no alphabet and no way of writing down
their language. But today many of them can read and write,
and there are even books and newspapers in Eskimo.</p>


<h3>PAPIK AND HIS CLOTHES</h3>

<p>A long time ago, an Eskimo boy named Papik lived in a
tiny village on Baffin Island. All winter his home was a round
little house built of snow, out on top of the frozen sea.</p>

<p>Papik was warm and comfortable in his snow house, and
outdoors he kept warm, too. He looked all bundled up in his
clothes made of animal skins, but his winter suit was really
lighter and softer than yours.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 442px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe10a.jpg" width="442" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Papik wore these clothes
in winter. His mother
sewed good luck charms
into them.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It was easy for Papik to get dressed. First he pulled on his
pants made of baby sealskin, with the soft, white hair on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
inside. Next he put on his deerskin stockings
and his slippers of bird-skin with the
feathers inside. Over these he drew a second
slipper of sealskin and his waterproof
sealskin boots.</p>

<p>Finally Papik slipped his jacket over his
head. He even had his cap on because it
was made right into his jacket.</p>

<p>Papik didn't have to fuss with buttons
or zippers. He just tied an animal-skin
thong around each leg to hold the tops
of his boots up. Now he was dressed in
his underclothes&mdash;which were also his
summer outfit.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe10b.jpg" width="500" height="308" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>His mother's jacket was extra
large so she could carry his
baby brother inside it on her
back.</p></div>
</div>

<p>To go outdoors in winter, he put on
an extra pair of pants and an extra jacket
made of deerskin with the hair outside.
These, with deerskin boots and mittens,
were all the clothes he needed for a trip
out over the ice with his father.</p>

<p>Each mitten looks as if it had two
thumbs&mdash;and it had. Papik's mother made
them that way so that he could turn them
around without taking them off and wear
them backwards if he got one side wet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe11a.jpg" width="500" height="219" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Eskimos lighted their
lamps by striking sparks from stones
called flint and pyrite.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Papik's sister Milak wore clothes almost
exactly like his. The grownups did, too.
When white men came to the Arctic, they
found Eskimo clothes were better for
winter there than anything else that
could be made.</p>


<h3>INSIDE THE IGLOO</h3>

<p>Papik and Milak had no regular bedtime.
They slept when they were sleepy.
Lamps burned in their house all the time
to give heat as well as light.</p>

<p>An Eskimo lamp worked in the cleverest
kind of way. It was made of soapstone&mdash;a
soft stone that could be hollowed out
into a bowl. This bowl was filled with oil
which came from seal fat, called blubber.
Along one side of the bowl ran a little
ridge of moss. This was the lamp's wick.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 308px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe11b.jpg" width="308" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>A cooking pot hung above the
lamp. The rack was for
drying clothes.</p></div>
</div>

<p>When the wick was lighted, it burned
with a hot, white, steady flame. The children's
mother watched it and was careful
that it never smoked. To keep the
lamp filled, she put a chunk of blubber
near the flame. As the flame burned it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
kept melting oil out of the blubber, and the oil kept oozing
down into the bowl where the wick soaked it up. The lamp
never ran over and never ran dry.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe12a.jpg" width="500" height="225" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Eskimos never scolded
their children for waking
them up.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Sometimes the round dome-shaped room got too hot and
the roof began to melt. Then Papik would go out with his
snow-cutting knife and help his father fix the drip. Instead
of patching the roof, they shaved it down! This made the
ceiling colder, and the dripping water froze. When the house
was not warm enough, Papik and his father went out and
heaped more snow on the roof and sides. This kept the cold out.</p>


<h3>BREAKFAST IS READY</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 119px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe12b.jpg" width="119" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Sometimes new puppies were kept warm
in the rack over the lamp.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The seal oil lamp was also a cooking stove. When Milak
and her mother wanted to cook, they hung a soapstone pot
over the flame. They melted ice and snow for drinking water
in a pot, too. Some of the ocean ice was too salty for drinking
water. But many Eskimos knew that when ice was a year or
more old it lost its saltiness, and that was the ice they melted.</p>

<p>Milak didn't have to help with much cooking. Eskimo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
families on Baffin Island liked meat and fish raw. In fact,
that is where the word Eskimo came from. It was the name
that the Indians gave to their neighbors in the north, and it
meant "People-who-eat-their-food-raw."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe13a.jpg" width="500" height="63" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>fork</p></div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 120px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe13b.jpg" width="120" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>spoon</p></div>
</div>

<p>Before breakfast time, Milak went outside and got a chunk
of frozen fish. The whole outdoors in winter was a deep-freeze,
so it was easy to keep a good supply of food. Milak
tossed the fish on the floor. When it had thawed till it was
about as soft as cream cheese, her mother cut off the best chunks
for the children. Grownups didn't start to eat till the children
had been served.</p>

<p>In winter it was breakfast time whenever anybody woke
up and began chattering to the others. Because it was so dark
outside in the long winter night, nobody kept track of time.
Eskimo families just slept and woke when they felt like it.</p>


<h3>GETTING READY FOR A TRIP</h3>

<p>Even when it was quite dark Papik sometimes went hunting
with his father. First they got their sled ready. The sled
was made of bone and pieces of driftwood, with a high pair
of deer antlers for handles at the back. Its runners had to be
slick and smooth so that the dogs could pull it easily.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe13c.jpg" width="500" height="405" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Eskimos had different kinds of sleds.
This was Papik's.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe14a.jpg" width="500" height="394" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Hunters riding on sleds
never talked to each
other. If they did, the
dogs would stop and
listen.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Long ago the Eskimos discovered that a coating of ice
made a sled's runners good and slick. But ice won't stick very
well to bare wood or bone. So this is what they did: At the
beginning of winter they plastered the runners with a thick
coat of mud and decayed moss, which would stick tight when
it was frozen. Now an ice coating would stick to the mud.</p>

<p>Each time Papik used the sled, he iced the runners. He
filled his mouth with water and squirted it back and forth.
As the water froze, Papik squirted on more, until he had a
thick layer of ice over the mud and moss.</p>

<p>Next Papik and his father put harness on the dogs and
hitched each one separately to the sled. While the dogs barked
and quarreled with each other, Papik hung a snow knife and a
rope made of skin over the sled's handles. He put a harpoon
and a big polar bearskin on the bottom of the sled, and now
they were ready to start.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe14b.jpg" width="500" height="366" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>A snow knife made of walrus
ivory for cutting snow</p></div>
</div>

<p>Papik's father snapped his long whip over the dogs' heads.
He could make the whip crack right near a dog's ear without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
ever touching it. Papik could do this, too. By the time he was
six years old, he could aim the whip anywhere he wanted to,
although the lash was more than twenty feet long.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe15.jpg" width="400" height="500" alt="" />
</div>

<p>At the whip's crack, the sled was off. The team spread out
like a fan behind the lead dog, who was a natural leader and
always traveled at the very front. Papik sat on the bearskin
behind his father who used the whip to guide the dogs.</p>


<h3>PAPIK HUNTS SEAL</h3>

<p>At a place where they thought there might be seals, Papik
and his father stopped. They turned the sled upside down and
pushed the points of the runners and the antlers deep into the
snow. The sled had to be an anchor to hold the dogs while
the Eskimos hunted. Now Papik unhitched the lead dog and
held tight to his harness strap. The dog ran ahead, sniffing
the snow. He was looking for a seal hole.</p>

<p>Although seals lived in the water, they weren't like fish.
They had to come up for air. When the ocean froze, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
gnawed many breathing holes through
the ice. They could get plenty of air
through the holes, even when a blanket
of snow covered the ice.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe16a.jpg" width="500" height="38" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>The harpoon handle came loose from the barb.</p>

<p>The sharp barb of the
harpoon acted like
a fishhook.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 245px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe16b.jpg" width="245" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>The hunter held on to a line
attached to the barb and
pulled the harpoon handle
out, so it would not break.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Suddenly the lead dog began to bark.
He had smelled a seal hole. Papik pulled
him away and ran back to the sled. He
must not let the dog frighten the seal
away.</p>

<p>Papik's father poked around in the
snow till he found exactly where the hole
was. Then, with his snow knife, he
carved a snow seat so he could be comfortable
while he waited for the seal to
come. He put a piece of fur under his
feet with the hair side up. He might have
to wait motionless for hours, and he had
to keep his feet warm. Beside him he laid
his harpoon&mdash;a special kind of spear with a
line attached to it.</p>

<p>For a long time Papik played near the
sled. At last his father's sharp ears caught
a little noise. It was a seal breathing.
Quietly he stood up, plunged his harpoon
straight down, and hit the seal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption"><p>A woman's knife was

</div>

<p>Papik came running at his father's shout. Together they
chipped the ice away from the edges of the hole, making it
big enough so they could pull the seal out and kill it.</p>

</div>

<p>Now they took little ivory pins and closed up the slit that
the harpoon had made in the seal's skin. They didn't want any
of the animal's blood to spill out. Seal blood was an important
food. And when it was prepared in a special way, the children
often used it for chewing gum, too! Papik's family, and the
dogs as well, would have plenty to eat when they got home.</p>


<h3>A USE FOR EVERYTHING</h3>

<p>Milak and her mother were ready to cut up the seal with a
special knife, called a woman's knife. They cut the blubber
away and carefully peeled off the thin layer of skin between
the blubber and the hide. When this thin skin was dry, they
would use it like cellophane, for wrapping things.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 221px;">

<p>An Eskimo woman could do wonderful things with her
hand-carved ivory needles and the thread made of animal
tendons called sinew. She could join skins together so that
they were absolutely watertight. As Milak and her mother
worked, they sang. Milak made dolls out of scraps of fur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>


<h3>BUILDING A SNOW IGLOO</h3>

<p>When Papik and Milak weren't busy, they played outside
in the snow with other children. They tumbled around with
the puppies, threw snowballs and slid down their houses.</p>

<p>The houses were very strong. They could last all winter.
But very often a family or a whole village would pack up and
go off to find new hunting grounds or just to visit another
village. When they moved, they built new houses, if they
didn't find empty ones to use.</p>

<p>It took only a few hours to make a new house. This is how
Papik's family did it: His father looked for a place where the
snow had drifted deep in one big storm, so that he could get
solid, even chunks of it. (Snow on level places in Eskimo land
was seldom very deep!)</p>

<p>With his snow knife Papik's father cut out blocks about the
size and shape of a small suitcase and placed them in a circle
ten or twelve feet across. Each block leaned inward.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 399px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe18.jpg" width="399" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>The second row of blocks
began to spiral
upward.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>After the first row of blocks had been
laid, Papik's father shaved two of them
down, the way you see in the picture.
When he laid the next row, the blocks
began to slant in a spiral, upward and inward.
Soon, the spiral almost closed in
over his head, because he worked inside
while his family worked outside.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe19a.jpg" width="500" height="232" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>This snow house
would be used for
hunting or a short
visit. It had no
window.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Finally, there was only a small hole at
the very top. He cut a block just the
shape of this hole and fitted it into place.
Now he was inside a house that had no
door!</p>

<p>But he and his wife had already decided
where to put the door. So he
started to dig his way out, making a tunnel
<em>under</em> the wall. At the same time, his
wife tunneled toward him from the outside.
After a while they met. Now they
made the tunnel strong by roofing it over
with snow blocks.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 357px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe19b.jpg" width="357" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>A regular house had a window
made of seal intestines sewed
together. Or it might have a
pane of thin clear ice.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Papik and Milak were busy all this
time, too. They pushed loose snow into
the cracks between the blocks. Then they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
helped shovel more snow all over the house and tunnel. When
they were through, it looked just like a snowdrift.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 142px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe20a.jpg" width="142" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>unpacking dry heather</p></div>
</div>

<p>Inside, their father cut a small hole up through the roof
for ventilation. Cold air would come into the house through
the tunnel. Hot air would leave through the hole in the roof.</p>

<p>Next, their father dug the middle of the floor deeper, leaving
a snow bench all around the circular room. He tramped
hard on the floor to pack it down. Then he sprinkled water on
it to give it a hard finish.</p>

<p>Milak and her mother were ready to make the beds. They
unpacked bundles of dry heather&mdash;a plant with tough, springy
stems&mdash;that they had collected in the summer. They spread
the heather on the snow benches. This was a mattress. Over it
they laid deerskins, making one big blanket for the family.</p>

<p>The snow benches were seats as well as beds. Often Papik
and Milak sat there cross-legged, while their parents made tools
and clothes or sang or told long stories.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<img src="images/bbtfboe21.jpg" width="500" height="219" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Outdoors the sky was sometimes filled with weird, quickly
changing colored light, which we call the Aurora Borealis or
Northern Lights. This is the way Papik's father explained the
lights: Even though people died, their spirits kept on living.
Some of them were in the sky. The changing, jumping lights
were really spirits having a wonderful time playing a kind of
football game&mdash;kicking a walrus head around.</p>


<h3>SUMMER COMES</h3>

<p>As the days grew longer, late in winter, Papik and Milak
played outdoors more and more. Then one day when Papik
climbed on top of the snow house, the roof suddenly caved
in! Summer had come. Papik wasn't really surprised. Summer
in the Arctic always came in a sudden burst. There was no
gradually warming spring.</p>

<p>Nobody scolded Papik for breaking the house. Instead, his
family moved into a deerskin tent on the land, where they
would live all summer. Dozens and dozens of different kinds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
of brilliantly colored flowers bloomed in no time. Clouds of
mosquitoes appeared and made life uncomfortable for people
and dogs. The ocean ice broke up with great cracking noises.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe22a.jpg" width="500" height="209" alt="" />
</div>

<p>At first the earth was swampy and the Eskimos sometimes
starved because they couldn't hunt. As the ground dried out
the dogs carried small packs on their backs. The Eskimos had to
walk and carry big loads on their own backs, hung from straps
around their foreheads.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe22b.jpg" width="500" height="378" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>caribou</p></div>
</div>

<p>As soon as the ice had opened up in the sea and streams
and lakes, the Eskimos could travel on water, too. The whole
family sometimes got into an umiak&mdash;a big boat made of skins.
A man or boy could go out in a little skin boat called a kayak.</p>

<p>There was much work to do during the hot days&mdash;and
plenty of daylight in which to do it. The nights grew shorter,
until there was no night at all. The huge sun hung in the sky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
and never went down. Nobody in the village slept much.
Even the children went without any sleep at all for two or
three days at a time!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe23a.jpg" width="500" height="297" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Papik and his father hunted for deer. They used bows
shaped from deer antlers and strengthened with deer sinews
that had been glued to the horn. Their arrows had points of
flint or walrus ivory.</p>

<p>In summer, whales and walruses swam back from warmer
water into the Arctic Ocean. To catch them, an Eskimo hunter
used a big harpoon. Sometimes he could harpoon a whale from
land or from big cakes of ice near land. Often several men
went hunting together in an umiak, which had oars and a sail
made of seal intestines sewed together. The boat was so light
that two men could lift it, but so strong that it could hold two
or three tons of whale meat.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<div class="caption"><p>The umiak towed the
whale to shore.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Each hunter had his harpoon and line. Tied to the line was
a watertight sealskin blown up like a balloon. This was called
a float. After the hunters harpooned a whale, the animal tried
to swim away, but the floats dragged in the water and finally
tired it out. Then it was easy for a man to send a spear straight
into the whale's huge heart and kill it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 202px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe24b.jpg" width="202" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>a

</div>

<p>The whale belonged to the whole village. All the women
helped cut it up. And everybody agreed that the best food in
the world was the whale's skin and the blubber under it. They
cut this off in strips and ate some raw while it was fresh. Then
they cut the rest of the whale up and stored it under rocks so
that the dogs couldn't get at it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe24c.jpg" width="500" height="157" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>a drum</p></div>
</div>

<p>After a lucky whaling trip, the villagers naturally wanted to
celebrate. So they had a feast. A man beat a big flat drum
made of deerskin or sealskin stretched tight over a hoop of
wood or bone. People danced and sang songs they made up
as they went along. And everybody ate and ate and ate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>In the evening they played catch with a light ball made of
skin stuffed with moss. Or they whipped a heavier, clay-stuffed
ball around the village with the long whips they used
for their dog teams.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 292px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe25a.jpg" width="292" height="403" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>a

ball</p></div>
</div>

<p>There were other games at feasts, too. The men had archery
contests with bows and arrows. When a man hit the target,
the women showed their approval by running up and rubbing
noses with him.</p>

<p>If a strange man came, there was usually a boxing match
between him and one of the village men. If the stranger lost, he
might have to go away. Life was so hard that only strong people
were wanted in an Eskimo village.</p>

<p>Papik practiced these games, just as he practiced hunting.
Before long he would be a man and would do the things a
man did. There would be a feast when people agreed he was
grown up. By then he could take care of himself, even if he
was far from any village, all alone in the winter snow.</p>

and hide. They invented ways of hunting
powerful polar bears with only small

new kind of lamp, which was perfect for
their needs. They made the coldness of
the Arctic work for them, when they
turned ice and snow into useful tools.
They could even make their food do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>

of frozen skins and meat or fish. Later
they and their dogs could have a feast of

<h3>THEY SHARE WHAT THEY HAVE</h3>

<p>Eskimos were so good at working with their hands that they
could use their wonderful inventions to live alone if they
wanted to or had to. But they were very sociable, too. They
made lots of visits&mdash;and long visits. Nobody ever knocked
when he entered a friend's door. In fact, the Eskimos had no
word for "Hello." Visitors were expected to come right in.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 306px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe28c.jpg" width="306" height="443" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>walrus</p></div>
</div>

<p>As long as there was anything to eat, no Eskimo ever went
hungry. Eskimos always shared their food and houses. No one
ever owned a house after he moved out of it. But to show that
he intended to come back home, he left some tools in his
house. Tools, dogs, clothes, good luck charms and toys were
about the only things an Eskimo called his own personal property.
It never occurred to an Eskimo to pile up wealth enough
to hire someone else to work for him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 246px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe28d.jpg" width="246" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>narwhal</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Eskimos had no laws about sharing. They knew they
<em>must</em> share in order to live at all. They had no chiefs as Indians
had, and no police or prisons or warriors.</p>

<p>If people decided something an Eskimo did was wrong,
usually they just wouldn't talk to him, or they asked him to
leave the village. That was real punishment. Nobody liked a
man who was too lazy to hunt, but they divided their food
with him and his family anyway. They shared with orphans,
too. Every child had a home. Eskimos loved children.</p>

<h3>MACKENZIE ESKIMOS</h3>

<p>Papik and Milak had never seen a white man. They lived
in the days before explorers began to visit the far north country.
But other Eskimos had already met white traders and
men who hunted whales in sailing vessels.</p>


<p>The village where Hilltop and his sister, Driftwood, lived
was near a whaling station at the mouth of the great Mackenzie
River in Canada. The children knew some traders and
thought they were very funny people indeed. To begin with,
white men always had at least two names. No Eskimo ever
had more than one, and it was always the name of someone
who had died. Eskimos thought that these names were
unhappy and brought bad luck unless they were given very
soon to a new baby. There were no special girl names, like
Mary, or boy names, like John. Any name was good for either
a boy or a girl.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 469px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe29b.jpg" width="469" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Hilltop used a double-ended
paddle for his kayak.</p></div>
</div>

<p>White men looked peculiar, too&mdash;their beards, for instance.
Eskimos almost never had beards, but white men either
shaved or had a lot of hair on their faces. White men's beards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
were a nuisance in winter, because they
filled up with icicles and made faces
freeze.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 304px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe30a.jpg" width="304" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Dogs helped hunt bears. The men
had to aim their guns carefully.
A good dog was worth more
than a bearskin.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Even funnier were the traders who had
hairy faces but no hair at all on the tops
of their heads. Hilltop and Driftwood
had never seen a bald Eskimo.</p>


<h3>USING NEW THINGS</h3>

<p>The Eskimos laughed at all the things
that seemed so strange and foolish to
them. They laughed, too, about the useful
things that the white men brought. It
was good to light a seal oil lamp with
matches instead of a bow-drill. It was safer
to kill a polar bear with a gun than with a
spear.</p>

<p>Now that the Eskimos had guns, hunting
was easier, but they had to do more
of it. They killed animals for their own
use, and they did extra hunting because
they needed furs to trade with the white
men for bullets and guns and new things
to make their homes more comfortable.</p>

</div>


<h3>NEW WAYS AND OLD</h3>

<p>Hilltop and Driftwood lived in a house made of logs covered
with sod. The sod was grass, dug up with the earth
around the roots when the ground wasn't frozen. It helped to
keep the houses warm.</p>

<p>Look at the picture and you will see how different this log
cabin was from the ones you know about. The walls sloped
inward, instead of going straight up. This was important for
two reasons. First, piling chunks of sod was easier against
sloping walls than against straight ones. Second, the slanting
walls made less space at the top. That meant less air to heat
than in a squared-off house.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe31b.jpg" width="500" height="172" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Eskimos played string
games like cat's cradle.
This one is a deer.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A log house was very warm. In fact, Hilltop and Driftwood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
felt uncomfortably hot when dinner was being cooked on
old-time lamps or over a new-fangled iron stove.</p>

<p>The grownups took off most of their clothes indoors, and
the children didn't wear anything. Everybody sweat a great
deal. This is how they wiped themselves dry: When the men
sat around the house at night, they often spent their time
whittling pieces of wood into toys or ornaments or tools. The
shavings they made were very small and fine, like excelsior.
Piles of the shavings were always heaped up at the side of the
room. When anyone got sweaty, he wiped himself dry with
the excelsior and threw it away. He used his towel only once,
so it never got dirty.</p>


<h3>THEY DIDN'T GET LOST</h3>

<p>In winter, Hilltop and Driftwood often went traveling with
their parents. Riding on sleds, they visited other villages, and
sometimes they built snow houses, just as Papik and Milak
had done. But their sleds were a little different, and the dogs
were not harnessed in the same way. Instead of hitching each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
dog separately to the sled, Hilltop tied them all to one line
and they all pulled together in single file.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe33a.jpg" width="500" height="181" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Eskimo dogs were tough and strong. Each one knew his own
name and the names of all the others in his team. A dog
usually hated to leave his team if he was sold. Sometimes he
would run away from his new master and travel as much as
sixty miles to get back home. Eskimos took good care of their
fierce, hard-working dogs, although they weren't gentle with
them. To train them and make them obey, Eskimos used whips.
But they had to be careful. Too much punishment made a dog
refuse to work at all. If their dogs hadn't worked and helped
them travel, Eskimos couldn't have found enough food.</p>

<p>Even though Eskimo families traveled far away over wide
snowy plains, they never got lost. They knew which way the
winds blew, and they could tell by looking at the snowdrifts
whether they were keeping on a straight course. In the darkest
night they could find their way just by feeling the drifts
with their mittened hands.</p>

<h3>FOOLING THE SEALS</h3>

<p>Sometimes Hilltop went with his father on hunting trips
when the ice was breaking up, and he learned about the
habits of seals. He learned that a seal is always watching out
for polar bears, which are its worst enemy. When a seal comes
out on the ice for a nap, it always chooses an open flat place.
That way it can hear bears, or see them, before they come
too close. And the seal gets its sleep in little snatches&mdash;often
only a half-minute nap at a time. Then it wakes up and looks
around.</p>

<p>On his first hunting trip, Hilltop saw the seals far off, wiggling
and scratching themselves with their flippers. And then
he saw his father crouch down and make the same motions!
As he crawled along over the ice, he wiggled and scratched.
He was making the seal think he was just another seal. Then,
when he was close enough, he raised his gun and shot it.</p>

<h3>FISH TO EAT</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 423px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe35a.jpg" width="423" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Men often fished this way
in spring and fall.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In winter, the men from Hilltop's village
also went fishing with nets which
they poked down through the ice. Driftwood
helped her mother clean the fish
with her special woman's knife&mdash;the kind
that Eskimo women used everywhere.
Then she did something many Eskimos
never used to do. She cooked the fish.</p>

<p>Once Driftwood tried sprinkling the
fish with salt that white traders had given
her. But her family didn't like it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 335px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe35b.jpg" width="335" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>The women hung fish and
meat up to dry like this.</p></div>
</div>

<p>If there were many fish, the women
cleaned them, took out the backbones
and stored them away to freeze. In early
summer and fall, they hung the fish up
to dry. Once in a while the men caught
so many that the women couldn't keep
up with them. Then they cleaned the fish
and tossed them into a big box. Later
they built a heavy log wall around it to
keep out bears and wolves. Hilltop and
Driftwood particularly liked to eat this
kind of fish raw, after it had been frozen
in winter&mdash;even if it was rotten.</p>

<h3>OPEN WATER</h3>

<p>As summertime came, the whole village waited for the exciting
time when the ice began to thaw and break up. The
whales and walruses came back into the Arctic Ocean. They
swam up between long cracks in the ice called "leads."</p>

<p>Eagerly the men and boys waited along the edges of the
leads. Who would see the first walrus? The day Hilltop went
with the men in an umiak to hunt whales in a lead was even
more exciting. The men paddled a long time before they saw
a whale blowing its waterspout in the distance. Then they
quickly pulled the umiak out onto the ice and waited.</p>

<p>Suddenly the whale came up to blow again, not far away.
The men all fired their guns at once, aiming at its heart, which
was deep in its body and as big as a barrel.</p>

<img src="images/bbtfboe36b.jpg" width="500" height="73" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>a Copper Eskimo bow</p></div>
</div>

<p>It took everybody in the village to pull the whale out onto
the ice. They used a block and tackle they had got from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
white sailors. Then, after the villagers had
cut up the whale, they held a great feast.
There was plenty of meat and blubber for
all&mdash;including the dogs&mdash;and whalebone to
be traded for more bullets and guns.</p>


<h3>NEIGHBORS</h3>

<p>Not very far from Hilltop's village lived
people that the white men called Copper
Eskimos because they had learned to use
copper for some of their tools.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 338px;">

<div class="caption"><p>A Siberian Eskimo teacher

</div>

<p>Other neighbors along the coast did a
new kind of work after white men came.
In their high, waterproof boots, they
waded into the ocean and chipped away
the black rocks near the edge of the water.
The rocks were really coal which the white
men wanted and taught them to use. Eskimos
have always kept on learning how
to make the most of the land in which they
live.</p>

<h3>GREENLANDERS</h3>

<p>Nearly half the Eskimos in the world
now live in Greenland. Not many of them
have ever seen a snow house, although
most of their huge island is covered with
ice.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 395px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe38.jpg" width="395" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>With luck a North Greenlander
can catch a hundred or more
small birds in an hour.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Greenland Eskimos have known white
men for more than nine hundred years,
but they still hunt in many of the old
ways. In the northern part of the island,
hunters use nets to catch little birds
called auks, which come there by the mil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>lions
on the exact day the last snow melts
in spring. It takes eight or nine auks to
make a good meal for one person!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe39a.jpg" width="500" height="273" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Sometimes Greenlanders paddle their
kayaks out to icebergs and perch high up,
on the lookout for seals. Instead of being
just pure white, the icebergs shine with
beautiful tints of blue and green and purple.
Greenlanders' clothes, too, are bright,
embroidered and decorated with many
of the colors of the Aurora Borealis.</p>

</div>


<h3>TROUBLE AHEAD</h3>

<p>Traders began to visit the Eskimos in Alaska a long time
ago. The Eskimos sold them caribou meat to eat and sealskins&mdash;and
whalebone. When the traders explained what the
whalebone was for, the Eskimos could hardly stop laughing.</p>

<p>Women down in the warm world wanted whalebone to
stiffen their corsets, so they would look thin where they
weren't. You can imagine how silly this seemed to the Eskimos,
who thought people looked best when they were plump
all over. But the white men traded them guns and cloth and
stoves and tea for whalebone, so they caught many whales.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 294px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe40b.jpg" width="294" height="319" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>a whalebone corset</p></div>
</div>

<p>For a while the Eskimos got along very well with their trading.
Then things changed. Most of the whales had been killed
off by white men whose ships could follow the whales all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
way as the great sea animals migrated from the Arctic Ocean
down toward the South Pole. Most of the walruses were gone,
too. The whalers killed them for oil and for their ivory tusks.
Next, the caribou began to disappear. Eskimo hunters had
killed most of them so that white men could have meat.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe41a.jpg" width="500" height="159" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Some Eskimos taught
reindeer to pull sleds.</p></div>
</div>

<p>By now, Eskimos had learned to need the things they got
from traders, and they were almost starving because so many
of their food animals were gone. They needed a new way to
make a living. What could they do?</p>

<p>At last the head of the American school for Eskimo children
had an idea. He thought of bringing reindeer from Siberia to
Alaska. Reindeer are a kind of caribou that has been trained
to live with men.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe41b.jpg" width="500" height="260" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Laplanders from Scandinavia
came to teach the Eskimos
how to herd reindeer.</p></div>
</div>

<p>He persuaded the government and some individual people
to try his plan. The reindeer could eat the grass that grew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
thick in the hot Alaskan summer. In winter they could use their
horns and hoofs to dig down through the thin Arctic snow and
eat lichens. A reindeer was a sort of combination horse and
cow! It provided meat to eat, milk to drink and strength to
pull heavy loads. Its skin was valuable, too.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe42a.jpg" width="500" height="307" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Alaskan Eskimo children often wear
dresses to keep their fur
clothes clean.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Reindeer were first brought to Alaska in 1891. Now there
are many, many thousands of them.</p>


<h3>ESKIMO COWBOYS</h3>

<p>The Alaskan Eskimos became the cowboys of the far north!
Each year they have reindeer roundups, much like cattle
roundups in the West. Of course, they don't ride horses
the way cowboys do. But they sometimes rope reindeers with
lariats, and they herd them into huge corrals for branding.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe42b.jpg" width="500" height="245" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Alaskan kayakers wear

</div>

<p>The thin reindeer hides are valuable, so Eskimos don't spoil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
them by burning on a brand. Instead they notch the edges of
the animals' ears in special ways. As the reindeer move from
the corral through a narrow chute, the cowboys cut the
notches, so that each man can tell his own animals.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe43.jpg" width="500" height="425" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Very few Eskimos have grown rich from their reindeer, but
reindeer herding has become an important way of making a
living for some of them. Others still hunt and fish. Some get
work part of each year on fishing boats or in mines or on the
docks loading ships. But most Eskimos are still very poor.</p>


<h3>ESKIMO ABC'S</h3>

<p>John and Susie Alook are Eskimo children who live in
Alaska today. Although they speak Eskimo at home, they go
to school and study English. They learn to read, write and
count.</p>

<p>Long ago, when Papik and Milak were children, no Eskimo
could count beyond twenty&mdash;the number of fingers and toes
he had. Any number bigger than that was just "more-than-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>one-can-count."
Some Eskimos only bothered to count to six. That
was enough, because they had so few things they needed to
count. If they caught a lot of fish, nobody cared to figure out
how many. The important thing was that the whole village
had enough to eat.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe44a.jpg" width="500" height="226" alt="" />
</div>


<h3>DOCTORS AND NURSES</h3>

<p>John and Susie Alook have first and last names. Eskimos
have borrowed this two-name custom and many others from
white people. They have had to learn about doctors and dentists,
too, because the Eskimos are not as healthy as they used
to be.</p>

<p>Before the white men came, most Eskimos never had decayed
teeth. Now they do. Measles, tuberculosis and other
diseases which they never had before make them sicker than
they make white people. But doctors and nurses are now helping
the Eskimos to prevent and cure these new diseases.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe44b.jpg" width="500" height="329" alt="" />
</div>


<h3>DANCING ON AIR</h3>

<p>When their village has a whale feast, John and Susie share
in the celebration and dance. This is how the dance goes: A
lot of people hold a big walrus skin that has hand-holes cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
around the edges. John stands on the skin
and they toss him into the air.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/bbtfboe45.jpg" width="200" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Dancers were sometimes tossed
twenty feet up in the air.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Higher and higher they toss him. He
keeps his balance, lands on his feet, over
and over again, dances in the air and
sings a song. At last he tumbles off his
feet, and it's someone else's turn. The
dancer who goes the highest is the winner.</p>

<p>John and Susie are proud of the way
their mother and father can dance&mdash;not
only the old-time dances but new ones,
too. Eskimos are just as good at the white
men's dances as the white men are themselves.
And they love singing just as much
as ever. Now they sing the songs they
hear on the radio as well as their own
songs.</p>

<p>The new world has brought many
changes and many problems to the Eskimos.
To be sure, they have new inventions,
but they have new illnesses, too.
Their old way of living is ended, and they
haven't yet found a good new way. But
they are still The Laughing People.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
